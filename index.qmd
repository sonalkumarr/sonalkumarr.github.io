## Bio

I am a third-year PhD candidate in the Neuroscience program at [the Jackson Laboratory](https://www.jax.org/people/sonal-kumar) in collaboration with [Tufts University](https://gsbs.tufts.edu/people/student/sonal-kumar). I am carrying out my thesis research in the [Carter lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-carter-lab), where I leverage high-performance computing environments and statistical modeling to analyze integrated multiomics data in order to study Alzheimer's disease.

Prior to beginning my PhD, I did my masters in Biotechnology and Bioinformatics from the [Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology](ibab.ac.in), after getting a bachelor of science in Biotechnology from [St. Xavier's College, Ahmedabad](sxca.edu.in).

On this website, you can find updates on my educational experiences, professional and scientific activities.

## Research interests

-   **Alzheimer's disease**
-   **Computational biology**
-   **Statistical genetics**

## Hobbies

When I am not in the lab, you can find me looking for new (*read: easy*) trails to hike in Acadia or starting a new creative project. This past year alone, I've tried my hand at many crafts, ranging from pottery to gem painting, even crocheting!
